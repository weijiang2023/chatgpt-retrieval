# Intro
LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It enables applications that are:
* Data-aware: connect a language model to other sources of data
* Agentic: allow a language model to interact with its environment

The main value props of LangChain are:
* Components: abstractions for working with language models, along with a collection of implementations for each abstraction. Components are modular and easy-to-use, whether you are using the rest of the LangChain framework or not
* Off-the-shelf chains: a structured assembly of components for accomplishing specific higher-level tasks

# Get Started

# Modules
LangChain provides standard, extendable interfaces and external integrations for the following modules, listed from least to most complex:

* Model I/O: Interface with language models
* Data connection: Interface with application-specific data
* Chains: Construct sequences of calls
* Agents: Let chains choose which tools to use given high-level directives
* Memory: Persist application state between runs of a chain
* Callbacks: Log and stream intermediate steps of any chain
